    "summary": "Talers is a SaaS writing platform that centralises drafting, note-taking, and publishing into one seamless environment. As Lead Designer, I shaped the product vision and led the design process, from research and ideation to delivery. The goal was to simplify fragmented writing workflows and help authors stay focused, organised, and creatively in control throughout their writing journey.",

        {
          "text": "The project began within 1Kubator, where the founder had identified a clear gap in the writing market. Existing tools forced authors to juggle several disconnected apps from note-taking and drafting to editing and progress tracking, creating friction and loss of focus. Talers was conceived as an accessible, all-in-one writing platform that simplifies this fragmented experience."

        {
          "text": "My role covered the full design spectrum, from discovery to delivery. I led design strategy, and brand development, while maintaining close collaboration with the founder, who handled full-stack development. The challenge was to create a platform intuitive enough for new writers yet powerful enough to support long-form, structured writing. The core problem was clear: writers were losing creative flow to disorganisation and tool overload."

Insights revealed that 76% of users relied on at least three different apps daily, and 68% lost focus when switching contexts. These findings informed the product's central goal: unifying the writing workflow into one frictionless environment."

I translated research insights into user journeys, wireframes, and high-fidelity prototypes. Each iteration was validated through usability testing, ensuring clarity and flow. I also designed the brand identity, a fusion of a book and butterfly, representing both structure and creativity."
