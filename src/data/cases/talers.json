  "title": "Where Stories Take Wing: The Making of Talers",
  "summary": "Talers is a SaaS writing platform designed to simplify and centralise the creative process for authors. Writers often lose time juggling multiple tools for drafting, notes, and organisation. Over 38 weeks, I led the product design from research to delivery of an MVP, working closely with the founder to define priorities and ensure technical feasibility. The result was a unified writing app that improved user productivity, engagement, and confidence.",

The product aimed to provide writers with a single, accessible platform to draft, organise, and prepare their work for publication.

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Writers relied on fragmented workflows, often using three or more separate apps for drafting, editing, and note-taking. This created friction, distraction, and a loss of momentum. From a business perspective, this also left space for a differentiated solution: an all-in-one writing platform that could offer both usability and focus."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "I ran user interviews, competitor teardowns, and ideation workshops with the founder and early testers to identify core needs. We prioritised features using value-vs-effort trade-offs, focusing on writing flows, notes, and progress tracking. I designed wireframes, user flows, and high-fidelity prototypes, then created a design system to support the founder’s development."
