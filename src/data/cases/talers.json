  "title": "Where Stories Take Wing: The Making of Talers",
  "summary": "Talers is a SaaS writing platform designed to simplify and centralise the creative process for authors. Writers often lose time juggling multiple tools for drafting, notes, and organisation. Over 38 weeks, I led the product design from research to delivery of an MVP, working closely with the founder to define priorities and ensure technical feasibility. The result was a unified writing app that improved user productivity, engagement, and confidence.",
